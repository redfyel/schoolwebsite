            The curriculum followed by the school adheres to the Central Board of Secondary Education. The school hosts teachers from ILM Bangalore, Karadi Path and Astragen who offer their services of Spoken English. The students receive training from these teachers and speak very good English. All students are well-spoken and have good manners. They politely greet and thank us after every session. 
            There is a good cooperation and coordination between the authority, staff and non-teaching staff to effectively run the school. Students and parents too are supportive and cooperate with the school. The overall atmosphere of the school and the surrounding environment was very friendly.

            Here, almost all the students were from a poor economic background. Parents work extremely hard to support their childâ€™s education. The school fee is mercifully kept on par with the earnings of its locality members. The students are monitored and brought up under strict discipline. Coming late to class after lunch break means a kneeling down punishment is issued. Offenders of any other sort are dealt with by the principal. Thus, I noticed a strict emphasis placed on discipline in this school.
            During lunch break, as most students are from this area, either they go home or their parents bring them their lunch. The principal actively rounds the school, making himself available to parents or  students. The younger children sit in their small ground where the teachers take good care of them. The older ones eat in their classrooms.

    <p>There are no benches so students sit down in the classrooms by removing their footwear in neat order. Yet they sit gratefully and attentively for long hours and listen carefully to the lessons being taught by their dedicated teachers.They nicely decorate their classrooms with educational matter. Each floor has a wash area and rooms facility for the students to utilize during the school hours. A dedicated set of non-teachng staff strive to keep the washrooms clean. </p>
