This is a website designed as a climax for the Community Service Project I have done in my second year for a duration of 8 weeks.
A team of four girls with me as the Team Leader regularly went to a high school and spread awareness on many student-specific topics such as "Career Planning", "Personality Development", "Useful Student Tech" and so on.
It was refreshing and quite an experience preparing throughout the week, navigating through the city every weekend and finally delivering the much awaited session. The students have received the content well. Only time will
let us know if our efforts were fruitful or vain. Notwithstanding the experience I gained is invaluable and I look back fondly at those days.

We couldn't help but notice the school's poor digital presence and decided a website would be apt for that promising school in this competitive day. This website is a basic one - it includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript for
an interactive, dynamic and pretty website. This is my first time ever working with anything 'web'. Huge thanks to @Preethams77 who's a star and the start! Presenting Nava Bharat Public School's unofficial website!
