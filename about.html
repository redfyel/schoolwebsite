        <p>School core values play a crucial role in shaping the character and development of students. 
            Duty, prosperity, integrity, and discipline are among the key values that schools often emphasize. Duty instills a sense of responsibility and commitment towards one's obligations, both academically and socially. Prosperity encourages students to strive for personal growth and success, while also fostering a mindset of contributing positively to the community. Integrity promotes honesty, ethical behavior, and the importance of doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. Discipline teaches students self-control, time management, and the ability to follow rules and regulations. 
            By instilling these core values, our school aim to cultivate well-rounded individuals who are not only academically competent but also possess strong moral character and a sense of social responsibility.</p>
